Code Web Chat's Generate Commit Message feature automatically creates meaningful commit messages. This saves you time and ensures your commit history remains descriptive and consistent.

## API message structure

```
<files>
  <file path="...">...</file>
  // other affected files...
</files>
Write a brief and precise summary for the following diff, limited to a single sentence if possible and nothing else. Use an imperative tone to ensure clarity and focus on the primary change or purpose.
[DIFF OF CHANGES]
```
