# Tips

Here are some tips and best practices for using CWC effectively.

## Context

Keep your context as short as possible carefully selecting what you show the model. LLMs are excellent pattern matchers and carefully scoping context pays off.

## Instructions

Always prefer single-turns by refining initial instructions over "chatting". Context once polluted, won't recover. Rather than delegating big detailed task to be implemented all at once, divide it into smaller chunks for easier assessment.
