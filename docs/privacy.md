# Privacy

CWC respects user privacy and does not collect any user data.

## Core principles

### Zero trackers

We do not use any analytics services, tracking pixels, or other monitoring technologies.

### Direct API communication

All your requests are sent directly to providers you set up with your own API keys.

### Local browser communication

A local WebSockets server is run for bi-directional message passing.

### Open source

The entire codebase is publicly available for review and audit. You can verify for yourself that the extension operates as described and adheres to these privacy principles.
