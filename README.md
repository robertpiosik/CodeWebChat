Code Web Chat (CWC) is a free and open-source AI coding extension designed for _speed_, built for VS Code family of editors (Cursor, Antigravity, VSCodium, etc.).

👉️ **Construct coding prompts for...**

- Chatbots—_ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, etc._
- APIs—_Gemini API, OpenRouter, local Ollama, etc._

👉️ **Apply responses**—interactive edits integration with checkpoints \
👉️ **Fully-featured**—code completions, commit messages, and more \
🫰 **Cost-efficient**—zero-overhead prompts optimized for [prompt caching](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching)

## Introduction

**With its focus on context engineering, Code Web Chat addresses pitfalls of coding agents.**

We believe that automatic inclusion of files in the context window based on keyword/semantic search is an overly-optimistic approach that may make the model reason about wrong things, possibly leading to regressions. These could be overwhelmingly hard to fix with the very approach that created them.

Although caring about what the model sees sounds like a chore, the reality is that it makes it easily steerable with examples and more focused on the primary task.

Code with AI in a way that foster codebase understanding and gets you fast and accurate responses!

## Enabling autofill in browser

Install the zero-setup Connector extension in your favorite browser and never copy and paste again!

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/code-web-chat-connector/ljookipcanaglfaocjbgdicfbdhhjffp)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/code-web-chat-connector/)

Like all of Code Web Chat, the extension is [open-source](https://github.com/robertpiosik/CodeWebChat/blob/dev/packages/browser) and works with minimal permissions for your absolute privacy and security.

**List of supported chatbots:**

- AI Studio
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Copilot
- DeepSeek
- Doubao
- Gemini
- GitHub Copilot
- Grok
- HuggingChat
- Kimi
- LMArena
- Mistral
- Open WebUI
- OpenRouter
- Qwen
- Together
- Yuanbao
- Z AI

> [!TIP]
> With the browser extension you can include markdown-parsed websites in context. Go to target website, click the extension's icon in the browser's toolbar and click _Enable for context_.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The _Apply response_ button placed under responses is not a means of automatic output extraction, it's an alias for the original _copy to clipboard_ button. Review the [content script](https://github.com/robertpiosik/CodeWebChat/blob/dev/packages/browser/src/content-scripts/send-prompt-content-script/send-prompt-content-script.ts) for implementation details.

> [!NOTE]
> Use [port forwarding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/port-forwarding) on port _55155_ when using remote machine via SSH.

## API tools for common tasks

**🛠️ Edit Context** \
Work on your codebase with natural language instructions.

**🛠️ Code Completions** \
Get accurate code at cursor from reasoning models.

**🛠️ Intelligent Update** \
Fix malformed AI responses.

**🛠️ Commit Messages** \
