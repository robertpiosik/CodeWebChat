## What is CWC?

CWC is a non-agentic coding tool for AI-assisted programming built by an independent developer.

üß© Compatible with VS Code, Cursor and Windsurf<br/>
‚úåÔ∏è 100% free and open source!

**Guiding Principles:**

- initialize popular chatbots‚Äîbut don't game them
- API features‚Äîpowerful yet simple to use
- respect privacy‚Äîzero tracking
- lightweight‚Äîunder 2MB

**CWC is for you if:**

- you're an experienced engineer working on a large codebase
- you're a student or hobbyist on a budget
- you love open source software! ü´∂

## Context

Other tools try to "guess" what pieces of the codebase matter for the given task, often struggling to get it right. They workaround this by overloading context hurting model's performance and your wallet.

CWC works differently:

- **You select** which folders and files are relevant to the task
- **You know** exactly how many tokens you have in the context

The result? Unmatched in accuracy and cost AI assistance.

> Too many tokens fighting for attention may _decrease_ performance due to being too "distracting", diffusing attention too broadly and decreasing a signal to noise ratio in the features. ~Andrej Karpathy

## Web chats

Use your favorite chatbot without tedious copy-pasting contents of files you want to include with your instructions.

**Operates in two modes:**

- General<br/>_Ask anything_
- Code Completions <br/>_Ask what fits the cursor position_

Prompts with context and instructions can be copied to clipboard or sent directly to any supported chatbot.

**Apply Chat Response** is a smart tool that automatically integrates multi-file changes with the codebase by modyfing exisitng files or creating new ones. Works with chat responses in three edit formats: truncated, whole and diff.

### Supported chatbots

_(alphabetically)_

- AI Studio
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- DeepSeek
- Doubao
- Gemini
- Grok
- HuggingChat
- Mistral
- Open WebUI
- OpenRouter Chat
- Qwen
- Yuanbao

The Connector extension is available in [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/code-web-chat-connector/ljookipcanaglfaocjbgdicfbdhhjffp) and [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gemini-coder-connector/).

> <small>**Legal Disclaimer:** After chat initialization, the extension does not read the incoming message. The injected _Apply response_ button is not a means of automatic output extraction, it's an alias for the original _copy to clipboard_ button.</small>

**TIP: Practice single-turns**

Chat conversations are only a construct of product interfaces, they hurt the quality of responses from the model and once your context is "poisoned" it will not recover. Whenever you're not satisfied with a reponse, **the best practice is to alawys refine your initial instructions and re-initialize a chat**.
