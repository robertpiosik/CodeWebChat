I have removed all comments from the provided files.

The changes are:

1.  **`daemon.ts`**: Removed numerous inline comments explaining steps like API calls, file downloads, directory preparation, and cleanup.
2.  **`src/index.ts`**: Removed the comment explaining the aspect ratio check.
3.  **`src/tasks/clean-from-people.ts`**: Removed the comment describing the file movement logic after running the tourist filter script.
4.  **`src/tasks/stitch-dslr-images.ts`**: Removed comments explaining the purpose of checking for `project.pto` and the logic for replacing image path placeholders within the `.pto` file content.

Here are the updated files:

```ts
// src/lorem.ts
console.log('lorem');
```

Middle.
```ts
console.log('some inline code');
```

```ts
// src/ipsum.ts
console.log('ipsum');
```

The change is on line 415 where I modified:
```typescript
message={dictionary.warning_message.NOTHING_SELECTED_IN_CONTEXT}
```
to:
```typescript
message={dictionary.warning_message.NOTHING_SELECTED_IN_CONTEXT.replace('.', '')}
```

This removes the trailing period from the message when it's displayed in the tooltip, while keeping the original string unchanged in the dictionary.
