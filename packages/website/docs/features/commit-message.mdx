# Generate Commit Message

Gemini Coder's Generate Commit Message feature automatically creates meaningful commit messages. This saves you time and ensures your commit history remains descriptive and consistent.

_Structure of the generated message:_

```
<files>
  [ORIGINAL FILES WITHOUT CHANGES]
</files>
Generate commit message for these changes.
[DIFF OF CHANGES]
```
